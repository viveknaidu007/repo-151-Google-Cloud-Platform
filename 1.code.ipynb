    "# Google compute engine vs App Engine :\n",
    "\n",
    "n general, Google Compute Engine tends to be less costly than Google App Engine for equivalent resources and workloads. However, the cost difference depends on the specific use case and how resources are utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences in cost structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Google Compute Engine (GCE):\n",
    "        Pricing is based on the resources you provision: number of vCPUs, amount of memory, storage, and network usage.\n",
    "        It's an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform, meaning you have full control over the VM and need to manage scaling, load balancing, and infrastructure.\n",
    "        More cost-effective for consistent workloads or when you need to control specific resources.\n",
    "        You can also use sustained use discounts or committed use contracts for savings.\n",
    "    Google App Engine (GAE):\n",
    "        Pricing is based on the requests served, instance hours, and scaling behavior (e.g., automatic scaling and resource management).\n",
    "        It's a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), so Google manages the underlying infrastructure, automatically scaling and optimizing resources.\n",
    "        Higher costs can arise due to the convenience of fully managed services, automatic scaling, and the app’s traffic patterns.\n",
    "        You are charged for things like instance usage, database connections, and API usage, which can get expensive if the app requires many requests or has unpredictable traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "    App Engine provides easier management and scalability at a higher cost, making it suitable for apps with inconsistent or bursty workloads.\n",
    "    Compute Engine is more cost-efficient if you need long-running, consistent workloads and are comfortable managing infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide which is more costly in your case, consider your application’s needs for scaling, workload consistency, and infrastructure management. For small, sporadic apps, App Engine may be more affordable due to its automatic scaling, but for large or persistent workloads, Compute Engine offers better control over costs."

    " **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** account, here’s a more streamlined guide on how to deploy your Flask web app on **Google Compute Engine (GCE)**. This version assumes you already have GCP set up and you want to replicate the same behavior as your local environment where images are stored in the project folder and rendered on the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites:\n",
    "- You have a **GCP project** and **billing enabled**.\n",
    "- **Google Cloud SDK** is installed and configured on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: **Set Up Compute Engine VM**\n",
    "1. **Create a VM instance** on GCP:\n",
    "   - Go to the **GCP Console** > **Compute Engine** > **VM instances** > **Create Instance**.\n",
    "   - Set these values:\n",
    "     - **Name**: `flask-app-vm`\n",
    "     - **Region/Zone**: Choose your preferred region and zone.\n",
    "     - **Machine type**: For small apps, use `e2-micro` or `e2-medium`.\n",
    "     - **Boot disk**: Choose `Debian 11` or `Ubuntu 20.04` with at least 20GB disk size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Open firewall ports for HTTP/HTTPS**:\n",
    "   - Under **Firewall** settings, check both:\n",
    "     - **Allow HTTP traffic**\n",
    "     - **Allow HTTPS traffic**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SSH into the VM**:\n",
    "   - After the VM is created, SSH into the instance from the **VM Instances** page.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, use the command:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     gcloud compute ssh flask-app-vm --zone=your-zone\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: **Install Required Software on the VM**\n",
    "Once logged into the VM, install the necessary packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Update the system**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sudo apt update\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Python, pip, virtualenv, and Nginx**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv nginx\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a virtual environment** and install dependencies:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python3 -m venv venv\n",
    "   source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "   pip install flask gunicorn\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: **Upload Your Flask App to the VM**\n",
    "1. **From your local machine**, upload your Flask app to the VM using SCP:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   gcloud compute scp --recurse /path/to/your/flask-app flask-app-vm:~/flask-app --zone=your-zone\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **On the VM**, navigate to the project directory:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd ~/flask-app\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: **Set Up Local Folder Accessibility**\n",
    "Ensure your Flask app correctly serves images from the local directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In your Flask app, ensure static files (like images) are served from a `static` folder:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='static')\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- If needed, create an `images` folder within `static` for uploaded or rendered images:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  mkdir -p static/images\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flask automatically serves files from `static/` and `templates/`, so any images you store in `static/images` will be accessible at `http://your-vm-ip/static/images/image_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: **Run Your Flask App with Gunicorn**\n",
    "1. **Test run the app** using Gunicorn:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi:app\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Make sure your project has a `wsgi.py` file where the Flask app is imported, like:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from app import app\n",
    "\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "       app.run()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Visit the VM's external IP on port 8000 (`http://your-vm-ip:8000`) to confirm it’s running.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: **Configure Nginx**\n",
    "1. **Set up Nginx** to act as a reverse proxy for Gunicorn:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/flask_app\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add this Nginx configuration:\n",
    "   ```nginx\n",
    "   server {\n",
    "       listen 80;\n",
    "       server_name YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP;\n",
    "\n",
    "       location / {\n",
    "           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;\n",
    "           proxy_set_header Host $host;\n",
    "           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n",
    "           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n",
    "           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       location /static {\n",
    "           alias /home/YOUR_USERNAME/flask-app/static;\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enable the Nginx configuration**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/flask_app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\n",
    "   sudo nginx -t  # Test for syntax errors\n",
    "   sudo systemctl restart nginx\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: **Configure Firewall to Allow Web Traffic**\n",
    "1. Open port 80 for HTTP traffic:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   gcloud compute firewall-rules create default-allow-http --allow tcp:80\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: **Access Your Flask App**\n",
    "1. Visit the external IP of your VM (from the **Compute Engine > VM Instances** page) in the browser:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   http://YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Your Flask app should now be running and serving static images from the local project folder!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 9: **Ensure the App is Persistent (Optional)**\n",
    "To make sure your Flask app runs automatically on VM restarts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a systemd service** for Gunicorn:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/flask-app.service\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add the following:\n",
    "   ```ini\n",
    "   [Unit]\n",
    "   Description=Gunicorn instance to serve flask app\n",
    "   After=network.target\n",
    "\n",
    "   [Service]\n",
    "   User=YOUR_USERNAME\n",
    "   Group=www-data\n",
    "   WorkingDirectory=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/flask-app\n",
    "   Environment=\"PATH=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/flask-app/venv/bin\"\n",
    "   ExecStart=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/flask-app/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:/home/YOUR_USERNAME/flask-app/flask-app.sock wsgi:app\n",
    "\n",
    "   [Install]\n",
    "   WantedBy=multi-user.target\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Start and enable the service**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sudo systemctl start flask-app\n",
    "   sudo systemctl enable flask-app\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that your Flask app will restart automatically on server reboots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Your Flask app should now be live and accessible over the internet, running on Google Compute Engine with local folders accessible for serving images. The behavior will mimic how it runs on your local machine, with images stored in project folders being rendered on the webpage."
