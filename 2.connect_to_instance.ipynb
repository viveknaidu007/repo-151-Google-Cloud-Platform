    "In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), uploading files to a VM instance using a `.pem` key (SSH private key) is quite similar to how you would do it in AWS. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide on how to upload your project folder to a GCP VM instance using a `.pem` key:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Ensure Your SSH Key is Set Up\n",
    "1. **Create or Locate Your SSH Key**: \n",
    "   If you haven't generated an SSH key yet, you can create one using:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/my-gcp-key.pem\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This will create a private key (`my-gcp-key.pem`) and a public key (`my-gcp-key.pem.pub`) in your `~/.ssh/` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add the Public Key to Your GCP VM**:\n",
    "   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n",
    "   - Navigate to **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.\n",
    "   - Click on the instance you want to connect to.\n",
    "   - In the **SSH Keys** section, click **Edit** and add the content of your public key (`my-gcp-key.pem.pub`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Upload the Project Folder Using `scp`\n",
    "1. **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt**: Open a terminal on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use the `scp` Command**: You can upload your project folder using the `scp` command while specifying the `.pem` key for authentication. The command format is:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   scp -i [PATH_TO_PEM_KEY] -r [LOCAL_FOLDER_PATH] [USERNAME]@[EXTERNAL_IP]:[REMOTE_FOLDER_PATH]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Replace `[PATH_TO_PEM_KEY]` with the path to your `.pem` key.\n",
    "   - Replace `[LOCAL_FOLDER_PATH]` with the path of your project folder on your local machine.\n",
    "   - Replace `[USERNAME]` with your GCP username or the default user (`gcp-user`).\n",
    "   - Replace `[EXTERNAL_IP]` with the external IP address of your VM instance.\n",
    "   - Replace `[REMOTE_FOLDER_PATH]` with the desired directory on your GCP VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example command:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   scp -i ~/.ssh/my-gcp-key.pem -r ./my_project gcp-user@35.238.17.66:/home/user/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Verify the Upload\n",
    "1. **SSH into Your VM** to check if the files were uploaded successfully:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ssh -i [PATH_TO_PEM_KEY] [USERNAME]@[EXTERNAL_IP]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-gcp-key.pem gcp-user@35.238.17.66\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Navigate to the Destination Folder** and check if your files are there:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd /home/user/\n",
    "   ls\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Tips\n",
    "- **Make Sure Your Key Has the Correct Permissions**: The `.pem` file should have restrictive permissions (read-only for the user). You can set this with:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   chmod 400 ~/.ssh/my-gcp-key.pem\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use `gcloud compute scp` as an Alternative**: You can also use the `gcloud` command to handle authentication automatically, which can be simpler:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   gcloud compute scp --recurse ./my_project [USERNAME]@[INSTANCE_NAME]:/home/user/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Command Recap\n",
    "Here’s a complete example command for `scp`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "scp -i ~/.ssh/my-gcp-key.pem -r ./my_project gcp-user@35.238.17.66:/home/user/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you should be able to upload your project folder to your GCP VM instance using a `.pem` key effectively."
