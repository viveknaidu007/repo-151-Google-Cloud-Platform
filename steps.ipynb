    "- **Find Gunicorn processes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  ps aux | grep gunicorn\n",

    "  This command will list all running Gunicorn processes along with their PIDs. Look for the lines corresponding to your Gunicorn server.\n",

    "  ```bash\n",
    "  kill <PID>\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Replace `<PID>` with the actual process ID you found.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Force kill if necessary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  If the process does not stop with the `kill` command, you can force it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  kill -9 <PID>\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **Best Practice**: Using a PID file is a clean and straightforward method for managing Gunicorn processes.\n",
    "- **Manual Method**: You can also locate and kill the process using the `ps` command if you didn’t set a PID file."

However, you received a warning indicating that the script is installed in a directory (`/home/viveknaidu6677/.local/bin`) that is not included in your system's `PATH`. This means that if you try to run `gunicorn` from the command line, it might not be recognized.\n",

    "\n",

    "   - For `bash`, you can edit `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`.\n",
    "   - For `zsh`, edit `~/.zshrc`.\n",

    "   export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Save the file** and exit the editor (in `nano`, you can do this with `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reload your shell configuration** by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",

    "To check if your Flask application is running successfully on your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) VM instance, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Accessing the Flask Application\n",
    "Since your Flask app is running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, it's only accessible from the VM itself. To access it from your local machine, you'll need to use the external IP address of your GCP instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Access the Application Externally:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Get the External IP Address**:\n",
    "   You can find the external IP address of your GCP VM instance in the Google Cloud Console:\n",
    "   - Go to the **VM instances** page in the Google Cloud Console.\n",
    "   - Locate your VM instance and note the **External IP**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Open Firewall Rules**:\n",
    "   Ensure that your GCP firewall allows traffic on port 5000 (the default port for Flask). You may need to create a new firewall rule:\n",
    "   - Go to the **VPC network** section.\n",
    "   - Select **Firewall rules**.\n",
    "   - Click **Create firewall rule**.\n",
    "     - Name: `allow-flask`\n",
    "     - Network: Select your VM's network (usually `default`).\n",
    "     - Source IP ranges: `0.0.0.0/0` (to allow all IPs) or specify your IP range.\n",
    "     - Protocols and ports: Select **Specified protocols and ports** and enter `tcp:5000`.\n",
    "   - Click **Create**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Access the Application from a Browser**:\n",
    "   After ensuring the firewall allows traffic, open a web browser and navigate to:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:5000\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Replace `<EXTERNAL_IP>` with the actual external IP address of your VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Using `curl` from the Command Line\n",
    "You can also check if the application is running by using `curl` from your local machine or even from the GCP instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:5000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Checking Logs\n",
    "If you're still unsure whether the app is running correctly, check the terminal where the Flask app is running. It should show requests being made to the server. You can also look for any error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Using a Different Port (Optional)\n",
    "If you encounter issues with port 5000, you can run the Flask app on a different port by modifying your `app.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000, debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then access it via `http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:8000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "After following these steps, you should be able to access your Flask application running on your GCP VM from your local machine or check its status using command-line tools. If you have any issues or questions, feel free to ask!"

    "\n",
    "    Server Resources: Each worker consumes CPU and memory resources. Ensure your server has enough CPU cores and memory to support additional workers without causing performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Application Load: If you anticipate high traffic (more than 10 simultaneous users, for example), increasing the number of workers can help handle the load better. A common rule of thumb is to set the number of workers to (2 * CPU cores) + 1, but you might adjust this based on your specific application performance and resource usage.\n",
